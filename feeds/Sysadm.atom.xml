&amp;quot;management&amp;quot; run with RabbitMQ. I was running ubuntu 10.04 (LTS) and did
sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, it was a mystery how to enable the plugins. There were no
default plugin directory existing, but thats solved by adding it
yourself. You can find your rabbitmq directory with whereis, e.g.
&amp;quot;whereis rabbitmq&amp;quot;. Then you just create a folder called &amp;quot;plugins&amp;quot;
inside the folder called rabbitmq_version, in my case:
/usr/lib/rabbitmq/lib/rabbitmq_server-1.7.2/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above case, i didnt get it working, as the management interface
isn't compatible with 1.7.2, which is bundled with the LTS. So now I'm
investigating the possibility to upgrade it via their custom apt-get
repository available from their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the reason why im writing this, is that i spent a lot of time
not beeing able to enable the plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to run a script inside the bin folder in /usr/lib/rabbitmq/ -
both for enabling and disabling plugins&lt;/p&gt;

ubuntu server, i used VMVware fusions easy install feature and it didnt
take many minutes before everything worked, however, then i did sudo
reboot and got black screen, no reaction at all. However, after randomly
doing a couple of things, i tried to turn it off - and it actually
printed the different services going down. So i found out that it
default didnt activate any tty's, so you just have to switch to any one
of them, e.g. ALT + F1 (if you are on a macbook pro too, remember the FN
button in the combination, to actually use the F2 key)&lt;/p&gt;

Strings With Puppet&lt;/a&gt;. I got up and running with a few test machines
(while reading the book) within a couple of hours and i managed to do
some basic stuff. Furthermore i installed puppet-dashboard, an overall
pretty undocumented process. Maybe I'll write a post about this later.
However, i used many hours trying to debug this really annoying error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
err: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on
SERVER: Could not find class nginx in namespaces &amp;lt;class&amp;gt; at
/etc/puppet/manifests/classes/&amp;lt;class&amp;gt;.pp:3 on node &amp;lt;fqdn&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got this error after installing the nginx module, from &amp;quot;module forge&amp;quot;
- by install i mean git clone the github page. I put in into
/etc/puppet/modules/ and after adding nginx to a class, i was stuck with
this error. The solution, however, is really simple. When you clone the
nginx module, the directory is called puppet-nginx - you need to rename
it, so its called nginx and nothing else. This will remove this error. I
googled this thing for hours, hopefully this will be #1 next time
someone experience this. Please comment if you use Puppet and saw this
article! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
