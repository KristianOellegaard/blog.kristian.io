In Denmark we will soon have the next 4th yearly election for our
parliament "folketinget". However, it seems to be threatened by the
workers union PROSA, whose members are maintaining some of the most
important IT systems in Denmark (including the police systems and the
tax authorities). All these systems are maintained by CSC, who made a
lockout of some of the works unions members, which resulted in a strike
for even more members. If you ask me CSC reminds me of overpriced public
IT projects - it always ends this way. Furthermore, its really common
that every time they finish a project, that they charged many tax moneys
for, it seems to be lacking functionality. However, the public IT
administration seems to be married with them and continues to pick them
for every project. I think this is a great example of the public IT
administration failing once again - never pick the same supplier for all
the public service systems - you risk loosing them all simultaneously.
